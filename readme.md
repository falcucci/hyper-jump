hyper-jump is an agnostic all-in-one and cross-platform command-line version manager toolset which I have created and used personally based on internal tools I daily interact with for many different reasons, that being for educational purposes or as a professional project/task.

## Core Features

- **Version Management**: Install and switch between different versions of Cardano ecosystem tools.
- **Environment Isolation**: Create isolated environments for different projects, each with its own set of package versions.
- **Remote Listing**: View available versions of packages from remote repositories.
- **Package Installation**: Download and install specific versions of packages with ease.
- **Package Uninstallation**: Remove installed versions of packages to declutter the environment.
- **Version Switching**: Seamlessly switch between installed versions with a single command.
- **Version Cleanup**: Erase all installed versions of packages to start fresh.
- **Proxy Handling**: Hyper-Jump acts as a proxy, allowing users to run commands from the selected package version.

## Potential Features

- **Updates notification**: Notify users when new versions of packages are available.
- **Custom Package Sources**: Allow users to add custom package sources or repositories for more flexibility.
- **Enhanced List Filtering**: Provide options to filter the list of installed and remote versions based on criteria such as release date or stability.
